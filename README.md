# Design-for-Fir-Filter-for-DSP-Applications
A Verilog-based implementation of an FIR Filter for DSP applications. it  includes the FIR filter RTL design, testbench, simulation waveforms, and ModelSim setup. The design uses shift registers, coefficient multiplication, and MAC operations to generate the filtered output. Suitable for VLSI beginners and  digital signal processing using HDL.
